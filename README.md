# Dynamic YouTube Video Title Update

## Introduction
This repository contains a JavaScript function that enables the dynamic update of a YouTube video's title based on its statistics, including view count, like count, and comment count. The function leverages the YouTube API to retrieve the necessary data and modify the video's title accordingly.

## Usage
To use the function, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `youtubetitle.js` file in a web browser.
3. Ensure that you have a valid YouTube video ID available. If not, obtain one from your desired video on YouTube.
4. Update the `videoID` variable in the `myFunction` JavaScript function with your YouTube video ID.
5. Save the changes and reload the `youtubetitle.js` file in the web browser.
6. The video's title will be updated dynamically, reflecting the current view count, like count, and comment count.

## Dependencies
This project relies on the following dependencies:

- YouTube API: This API allows us to access and retrieve video statistics.
- JavaScript: The code is written in JavaScript, enabling the dynamic modification of the video title.
